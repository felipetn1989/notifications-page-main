## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project the user can click on each unread message individually (the individual notification will go through the appropriate style changes and the notifications number will change accordingly) or click on the Mark all read button (then all the changes will happen simultaneously). Any feedback is welcome!
